# Babysitter Kata

## Background
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  The rules are pretty straight forward.

The babysitter:
- starts no earlier than 5:00PM
- leaves no later than 4:00AM
- gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
- gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
- gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)


## Feature
*As a babysitter<br>
In order to get paid for 1 night of work<br>
I want to calculate my nightly charge<br>*


## Build and Run
This project includes Gradle for easy project
building and running.

Full disclosure: I still have never used Gradle much before.
I do not know if it is working or not.
I also have only used git minimally.
I would much rather be honest yet show my
willingness and ability to learn quickly.


## Thank you!
Thank you so much for this experience.
It was really fun and great learning.
